1. **Title and Initial Impressions**: The title "My funny Valentine" immediately sets a tone of affection mixed with humor. The word "Valentine" suggests a romantic context, while "funny" introduces an element of lightheartedness or endearment.

2. **Opening Lines**: "Sweet comic Valentine" reinforces the initial impression. The juxtaposition of "sweet" and "comic" suggests a duality in the subject's nature—someone who is both endearing and amusing. This duality is central to the speaker's affection.

3. **Emotional Connection**: "You make me smile with my heart" indicates a deep emotional connection. The phrase "smile with my heart" suggests a genuine, heartfelt joy that transcends mere physical attraction.

4. **Physical Description and Perception**: "Your looks are laughable / Unphotographable" introduces a contrast between conventional beauty and the speaker's perception. "Laughable" might imply that the subject doesn't conform to traditional standards of attractiveness, while "unphotographable" suggests a beauty that cannot be captured by a camera, hinting at a deeper, more intrinsic allure.

5. **Artistic Appreciation**: "Yet you're my favourite work of art" elevates the subject to something precious and unique. Despite—or perhaps because of—their unconventional appearance, the subject is cherished as a masterpiece, suggesting that true beauty lies in individuality.

The reference to a "Greek" figure alludes to classical ideals of beauty, while the questions about the mouth and intelligence suggest vulnerability or insecurity.

8. **Repetition and Emphasis**: The repetition of "Stay little Valentine stay / Each day is Valentine's day" reinforces the desire for permanence and constancy in the relationship. By equating every day to Valentine's Day, the speaker expresses a wish for continuous celebration and appreciation of their bond.

9. **Overall Themes**: The text explores themes of love, acceptance, and the beauty found in imperfection. The speaker's affection is rooted in a deep appreciation for the subject's unique qualities, challenging societal norms of beauty and intelligence.

10. **Hidden Nuances**: The playful tone and rhetorical questions suggest a teasing, intimate relationship where both parties are comfortable with each other's flaws. The repeated plea for the subject to "stay" underscores a fear of loss, hinting at the speaker's vulnerability and deep emotional investment.
